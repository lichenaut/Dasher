Caching:
    Dasher caches player sequence information to improve performance. Cache is updated on player join if the player's permissions for sequences have changed.
    If you want to update players' sequences manually (ex. in real-time after adding a permission), execute '/dasher rebuild <uuid>' after adding the permission.
    Cache is cleared when you edit your sequences in config.yml.
